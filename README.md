# My UNC Bootcamp PreWork Study Guide

## Description

My motivation to create this study guide was to prove to myself that I can code! I built it, not only as an assignment, but as my first published website. I wanted to build this to expand on the little coding knowledge that I had prior to this assignment and build my coding skills. Creating this solved a few problems for me - one of which was creating multiple pages and linking them together (CSS to the index file). I tried to do this once before this course and was not as successful as I was this time. I learned a lot when it came to building this website. I learned how to make visual changes including font styles/sizes and the difference between padding and margin! I also learned that you can write in a console and not have it visually effect your webpage.

## Usage

To use this PreWork study guid you can read through each topic and learn something new!(hopefully). You can see that each topic has numerous facts/instructions to help me in the future. For example, I wrote instructions/facts in my Git topic to help me remember what order to run the functions in my terminal. If you were to inspect my webpage, you can see in the console 2 functions that have run. One is a list of the topics I learned about in PreWork and one generates a random topic to study, should the user of my website need help deciding what topic to study.
